'''
It's Friday the 13th, and Jason is ready for his first killing spree!

Create a function, killcount, that accepts two arguments: an array of array
pairs (the conselor's name and intellengence - ["Chad", 2]) and an integer
representing Jason's intellegence.

Ruby, Python:

counselors = [["Chad", 2], ["Tommy", 9]]
jason = 7
JavaScript:

var counselors = [["Chad", 2], ["Tommy", 9]]
var jason = 7

Your function must return an array of the names of all the counselors who can
be outsmarted and killed by Jason.

Happy Friday the 13th!

def kill_count(counselors, jason):
    kill_list = []
    if isinstance(counselors):
        for value in counselors:
            if value 

print kill_count([["Mike", 7],["Alysa", 3]], 7)
